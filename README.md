SoftwareEngineering2Project
===========================
Here is the initial version of our first programming project.

To start using this project, you must add a database in a new data/ directory, and must use npm in order to get the required modules.

In future version there will be a .gitignore file that will ignore all of the data files, and module files, because they are too large for GitHub to host.

This project does not include installations of MongoDB, or packages, so that will need to be added separately
